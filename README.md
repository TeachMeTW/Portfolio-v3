# Portfolio Project

## Description
This portfolio showcases the work, skills, and experiences of me. Designed with a modern user interface, it provides a comprehensive view of projects, tech stack, and other professional engagements. I did fork this from a tutorial so not everything is original but I made quite a fair bit of changes.

## Features
- Dynamic projects display with details.
- Nixie tube-inspired design for a unique user experience.
- Animated transitions for enhanced user engagement.
- Responsive design ensuring compatibility with various device sizes.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations

## Setup/Modifying
1. Clone the repository:
```bash

```
3. Install the dependencies (a bit buggy but gets the job done):

npm install --force
```
